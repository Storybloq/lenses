/**
 * T-024 typed control-plane error codes. Persisted on failed / expired
 * task records so a disk-hydrated session surfaces WHY a prior attempt
 * ended up in a terminal state, without smuggling that classification
 * through free-form strings.
 *
 * Control-plane, not model-plane: lenses never calls an LLM directly,
 * so these codes classify MCP-server-observable states (a malformed
 * payload, a duplicate submission, an expired deadline) rather than
 * LLM-generation failure modes. Codex-bridge's error taxonomy is the
 * inspiration; the codes here are narrower because lenses outsources
 * generation to the caller's subagents.
